# 3D-Game-Engine
 A 3D game engine in scratch from Java

This project was first created to clone the popular Javascript library, P5.js in Java. P5 is a library where graphics can easily be drawn, with much less math than doing it manually. I initially named it Dreasy (Draw Easy). After creating this, I began to wonder how I could draw 3D objects. This eventually led to this finished product where the player can walk around and place colored blocks. There is no libraries being used besides Java's Swing. The linear algebra, drawing tools, and renderer were created from scratch.
